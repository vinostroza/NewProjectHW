            <p style="text-align:center">Torres del Paine National Park, in Chile’s Patagonia region, is known for its
                soaring mountains, bright
                blue icebergs that cleave from glaciers and golden pampas (grasslands) that shelter rare wildlife such
                as llama-like guanacos. Some of its most iconic sites are the 3 granite towers from which the park takes
                its name and the horn-shaped peaks called Cuernos del Paine.</p>
